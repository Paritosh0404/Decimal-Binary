For second round I have attached the powerBI dashboard for visualization and the document stating the solution plan and the preprocessed dataset.





For 3rd round:
we have trained a weather model based on the preprocessed dataset and using that model we have created a webpage to deploy the model to get the result.


To see this webpage do the following steps:
1)Download that whole directory from repo
2)open the app.py file and run the command python app.py in terminal
3)click on the url in the terminal i.e: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
4)Now enter the data in the fields and click on predict to see the weather condition.
