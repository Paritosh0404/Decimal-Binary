For second round I have attached the powerBI dashboard for visualization and the document stating the solution plan and the preprocessed dataset.





For 3rd round:



we have trained a weather model based on the preprocessed dataset and using that model we have created a webpage to deploy the model to get the result.


To see this webpage do the following steps:



1)Download all the pkl files with app.py file and index.html file then make the new directory called templetes and move index.html into it. 





2)Now open the app.py file and run the command python app.py in terminal



3)click on the url in the terminal i.e: http://127.0.0.1:5000/



4)Now enter the data in the fields and click on predict to see the weather condition.
